Introduction

In this project, we attempt to predict the outcome of technology use on global poverty rates. 

Methods
ETL

- Sourced Data from World Bank open data
- Cleaned Data using Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Load Data into Mongo Atlas and ElephantSQL

Machine Learning
-SK-Learn for prediction and Clustering
-Tensor Flow for Neural Network 
-Google Collab to execute codes

Visualization

Outcomes 

We successfully trained a model to determine the five most important features using supervised learning clustering, as shown in Figure 1 below. We were also able to train our model with a 75% training score and an 84% test score, as shown in Figure 2 below. Additionally, we were able to use our machine learning model to predict the outcomes of the poverty change for the period of 2023-2025, as shown in the code snippet in Figure 3 below. 

Conclusion

Poverty affects most of the world's population, especially in Central America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Technology use positively affects poverty, but it's only a small portion of what's needed to reduce poverty in significantly affected countries.
